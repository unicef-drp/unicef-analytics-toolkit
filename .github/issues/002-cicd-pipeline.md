# [P0] Implement CI/CD Pipeline

## Priority
**P0 - Critical**

## Status
ðŸ”´ Open

## Description
No automated CI/CD pipeline exists, which means installation scripts are not tested across platforms automatically and breaking changes go undetected.

## Problem Statement
- Cannot test across platforms automatically
- No validation of installation scripts on commits
- No automated package version checking
- Breaking changes go undetected
- Manual testing burden on maintainers

## Proposed Solution

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### 1. Test Installation (`test-installation.yml`)
- Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Test with multiple R versions (4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
- Test with multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Run on push and pull requests

#### 2. Lint & Quality (`lint.yml`)
- Markdown linting
- R code linting (lintr)
- Python code linting (ruff, black)
- YAML validation

#### 3. Documentation (`docs.yml`)
- Verify all links work
- Check documentation builds
- Generate package lists

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-platform testing workflow
- [ ] Linting workflow
- [ ] Documentation validation
- [ ] Status badges in README
- [ ] Workflows run on every PR
- [ ] Clear failure diagnostics

## Estimated Effort
Low-Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
Requires: #1 Testing Infrastructure

## Labels
`P0`, `ci-cd`, `infrastructure`, `automation`
