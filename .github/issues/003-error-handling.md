# [P1] Improve Error Handling and Logging

## Priority
**P1 - High**

## Status
ðŸ”´ Open

## Description
Installation scripts currently have poor error handling that silently swallows errors, making debugging difficult for users.

## Problem Statement
- Errors are caught but not logged with details
- Users don't know why installations fail
- No troubleshooting guidance
- Error context is lost in retry logic

## Specific Issues

### install-r-packages.R (Lines 71-88)
```r
# Current: Errors silently swallowed
tryCatch({
  install.packages(pkg, quiet = TRUE)
  return(TRUE)
}, error = function(e) {
  return(FALSE)  # Lost error context
})
```

### install-python-packages.py
Similar issues with exception handling

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Structured Error Logging
- Log all errors with timestamp, package name, error message
- Create detailed log files in `logs/` directory
- Provide summary of failures at end

### 2. Error Recovery Guidance
- Suggest common fixes for known errors
- Provide platform-specific troubleshooting
- Link to documentation

### 3. Verbose Mode
- Add `--verbose` flag for detailed output
- Keep quiet mode as default
- Log all output in verbose mode

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All errors logged with full context
- [ ] Log files created in `logs/` directory
- [ ] Error summary at end of installation
- [ ] Troubleshooting suggestions for common errors
- [ ] Verbose mode implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6-10 hours)
